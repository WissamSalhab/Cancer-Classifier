# Cancer-Classifier
This model is created to classify the clump into two classes based on its characteristics:
We want the model to predict the value of Clump-Class (that is, benign (=2) or malignant (=4)). As this field can have one of only two possible values.

The best result in terms of accuracy is achieved in this project with the KNN algorithm at k = 4 where f1_score and Jaccard =0.985.
